First off, I didn't write this code. I tried and this was just too far outside of my abilities to do well. I hired a guy on Fiverr and he wrote it. He (tinratsy) doesn't appear to be on the site anymore so I cannot credit him properly nor put you in contact with him to write your code.  This code allows you to use an ESP32 with a KY-040 encoder and some buttons to make a home-brew video edit controller.
